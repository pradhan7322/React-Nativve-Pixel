## Overview

React Native Pixel is a robust mobile application built using [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev). This project aims to provide developers with a solid foundation for creating mobile applications efficiently. It utilizes [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) to streamline the setup process and enhance the development experience.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the project, ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native. To start Metro, execute the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Let the Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Use the following commands to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
